Title: Immigration and Population Replacement Rates: The Handmaid's Tale Effect

"The Handmaid's Tale" is a Hulu series that premiered in 2017 and has become very popular. It's about a futuristic United States in which the infertility rate has mysteriously skyrocketed, prompting the rich and powerful to enslave women who somehow maintained their fertility into giving birth.

Can this happen in the real United States?

Although this project doesn't directly answer this question, it does apply data analytics to answer the question of how a declining birth rate - the first major component of population change - should ideally be offset. Because controlling death rate - the second major component - is subject to many variables that are hard to control, this leaves the net international migration (NIM) rate - the third and final component.

The US Census Bureau, World Bank, Centers for Disease Control, and many other agencies project population growth for various reasons. In this project, we project population growth with a particular focus on how NIM affects it. The final and most important result is to calculate a NIM rate that will keep the growth of the population in the US from becoming negative.

The Resources directory contains input files from various agencies. Although the US Census API is used, it's only sparingly, since most of the data before 2012 is still either in CSV or in many cases PDF files. 

The Images directory contains output graphs produced by the code.

The ipynb files contain the actual code. The thien.ipynb was produced by Thien-An Doan. The phil.ipynb was produced by Phil Lowden. The other files - Net International Migration.ipynb, Projected Population.ipynb, and Total Population.ipynb - were produced by Lorelle Yuen. The presentation, Project-1-Group-6.pptx, was a community effort.

Note: the group lost 2 of its 5 members halfway through, so this had some effect on the ultimate scope of the project.
